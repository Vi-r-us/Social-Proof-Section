# Social Proof Section

I created a Social Proof Section, featuring a modern-looking UI design that is responsive to all screen sizes. This project was developed as part of the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). To achieve responsiveness, I utilized grid and flex layouts combined with media queries. Additionally, I enhanced the loading experience with keyframe animations and used pseudo-elements for certain sections.

## Overview

### The challenge

During this project, I faced various challenges, including managing different images for desktop and mobile views. To address this, I implemented image selection with media queries. I also delved into the basics of keyframe animations and their functioning. For improved and simplified UI, I used pseudo-elements and transform.
